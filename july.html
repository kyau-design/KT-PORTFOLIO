			<h2>Engagement Photoshoot at Stanley Park</h2>
			<p>July 17th, 2012 by <a href="about.html">kyau_design</a></p>
			<p>
				The photoshoot today went alright. We went location scouting several days ago to get an idea of areas of <a href="stanleypark.com">Stanley Park</a> would be worth visiting. Also did some research online to get inspiration and technical knowledge on camera settings to get optimal outdoor lighting. The whether was wonderful today, maybe a little too strong from the sun, but we improvised around it. Some difficulties we had would be contrasts between exposed areas and shadows on our models' faces as well as the busy atmostphere around the park on a hot summer day.

			<h2>Trial Indoor Portrait Shoot</h2>
			<p>July 17th, 2012 by <a href="about.html">kyau_design</a></p>
			<p>
				Today's trial photoshoot was intersting and fun. Being still new at lighting we didn't have the proper lighting equipment to light up the shot. We improvised by grabbing all the light stands we had in hand and putting it around the subject while remaining out of the frame. We definitely need to play around more with how to setup lighting as well as camera settings to get the ideal shots we want. Not all is lost in this trial photoshoot. I definitely learned more about placement of shots, and how the model poses also comes into play in creating the overall mood. I did go home today with several good shots that I can play around with in Photoshop.
