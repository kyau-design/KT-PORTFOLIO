		<h2>PERSONAL</h2>

		<p>I like to describe myself as a capturer of time. Similar to how Leonardo Da Vinci sat at the same spot for days learning how people interact and react, I enjoy sitting and observing the natural workings of my environment. I see things like how people behave when they are not being watched to how long a bird stays still to hunt for its prey. I often ask myself how many things are left unnoticed within our life? How many point of views and stories are left untold? This is my passion, I strive give people a greater appreciation for the worlds beauty and to bring unnoticed things back to the surface and re-establish their importance, because every story is a contribution. </p></br>

		<p>My name is Katie Yau and I am a photographer studying as a design and media arts student at SFU. My camera are my eyes and image editing softwares are my imagination. Everything that i observe is also an opportunity to tell a story. It's exhilarating for me to have the ability to create experiences and point of views for people that they normally would never see themselves.
